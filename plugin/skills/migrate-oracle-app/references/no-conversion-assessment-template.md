**Evidence note:** Lightweight static technology and database-reference inventory only. No
dependency installation, build, tests, coverage, Docker, target database calls, DDL, or source
changes were attempted.

## Executive Summary

**No application conversion required.**

Static inventory found no active JDBC, SQL, datasource, ORM, Oracle API/provider, migration-script,
or other database-facing application code that could be converted to PostgreSQL.
