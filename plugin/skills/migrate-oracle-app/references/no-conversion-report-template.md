# Oracle to PostgreSQL Application Code Conversion

**Run:** `<run-id>` · **Repository:** `<name>` on `<branch>` at `<commit>` · **Plugin:** `<version>`

**Evidence note:** Conversion stopped after lightweight static scope detection. No dependency
installation, build, tests, coverage, Docker, target database calls, DDL, or application changes
were attempted.

## Executive Conversion Summary

**No application conversion required.**

The detected application technology has no active database-facing or Oracle-specific application
surface to migrate to PostgreSQL.

## Conversion Outcome

✅ No conversion required

No application conversion required. PostgreSQL DDL and database integration testing are not
applicable. Passive artifacts remain unchanged and may be handled separately as optional
housekeeping.
